# Python
Python Code Repository For For Basic Codes To Some Intermediate Codes.

All Sugggestion Are Welcome On Code: Deepak008@live.com
`Please Mention Subject Python codes Github`

We Will Code Some Basic Like If Else, For loops
and some intermidate Python Library Like Pandas, Numpy, MatplotLib And Scipy.
And Some Machine Learning Codes.( Basic To Advance)

Then Data Visualization To Some Real Life Projects With Real life Data.
# Use Of Python In Various Field
> The detailed listings of the packages catered by Python language is provided in the Python Package Index. To include modules like GUI, Test, Automation, DB, Networking, Web Development, Image Processing, Text Processing, etc., Python consists of several standard libraries, which plays the following role-   

* ## Machine Learning- ML provides agility that helps in improvising AI machines with TensorFlow and Keras libraries.   
* ## Hadoop- With the help of Hadoop, Python employs Pydoop library to render support to Big Data processing.   
* ## Web Development- Frameworks such as Django, Pylons and Flask, which are coded in Python are considered to be more stable for developing websites.  
* ## Automated Testing- Automated testing tools like Selenium and Splinter have application programming interface that is capable of executing on Python. A developer can also test on cross platforms and cross browsers with the help of Pytest.  
* ## Graphics- By using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library, GUI applications can be written and run effortlessly.   
* ## Image Processing- PIL- Python image processing library supports imaging files from various formats.
